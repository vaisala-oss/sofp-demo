## Publishing new versions

The published website is in the branch "gh-pages". Developers do not need to concern themselves with this branch, as the library gh-pages (devDependency) handles all that.

To publish a new version:

`shell
npm run predeploy
npm run deploy
`

## Extra notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
